Hearts

Online desktop version of the classic card game Hearts. 
Written in C# with WPF using MVVM pattern and a little bit of MVVM Light Library.
Clients and server are connected via TCP protocol, I made up, quite suitable async/await architecture, so there shouldn't be any problems with connection quality.

I plan to convert that project into ASP.NET and Xamarin (Forms or Android)
